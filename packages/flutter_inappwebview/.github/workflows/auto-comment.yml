            Are you sure you have already searched for the same problem?


            Some people open new issues but they didn't search for something similar or for the same issue.
            Please, search for it using the GitHub issue search box or on the official [inappwebview.dev](https://inappwebview.dev/) website,
            or, also, using Google, StackOverflow, etc. before posting a new one.
            You may already find an answer to your problem!


            If this is really a new issue, then thank you for raising it. I will investigate it and get back to you as soon as possible.
            Please, make sure you have given me as much context as possible!
            Also, if you didn't already, post a code example that can replicate this issue.


            In the meantime, you can already search for some possible solutions online!
            Because this plugin uses native WebView, you can search online for the same issue adding `android WebView [MY ERROR HERE]` or `ios WKWebView [MY ERROR HERE]` keywords.


            Following these steps can save you, me, and other people a lot of time, thanks!
